# RFM Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves conducting RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on customer transaction data. RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that uses past purchase behavior to divide customers into groups. It is based on the premise that:

- **Recency**: Customers who have made a purchase recently are more likely to respond to new offers.
- **Frequency**: Customers who purchase frequently are more engaged and more likely to respond positively to promotions.
- **Monetary**: Customers who spend more are often more profitable.

This project aims to leverage these insights to drive better marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and improve overall business performance.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing to standardize customer names and ensure data integrity.
- Calculation of RFM scores for each customer based on transaction history.
- Segmentation of customers into meaningful groups based on their RFM scores.
- Application of conditional formatting to highlight significant changes in customer behavior.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Microsoft Excel**: The analysis is performed using Excel, leveraging its powerful data processing and visualization capabilities.
